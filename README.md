#  Bear Identification

Goal: The goal of this application is to aid in the proper identification in the American Black Bear (Ursus americanus) versus the Brown Bear (Ursus arctos), often referred to as the Grizzly Bear in inland North America.  In several areas throughout North America, these two species co-exist on the landscape and are often misidentified, which can be dangerous for both humans and bears.  In areas of North America where hunting seasons exist for either species, it is not an uncommon occurence for the wrong species to be shot.  This is due to a variety of factors, namely the commonalities between the two types of bears and misconceptions about definitive ways to tell them apart.  Their common names are certainly the biggest contributor to their mistaken identities; black bears are not always black and brown bears are not always brown. Along the same lines, brown bears are not always larger than black bears. There are however many distinctive features of each species which allow the viewer or hunter to make an accurate assessment of the species.  The goal of this application is to dispel the misconceptions and inform the user of those characteristics which can reliably aid them in identifying the correct species of bear, preventing unfortunate mistaken identities in the future.
